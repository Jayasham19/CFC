      <h2 class="fw-bold text-success mb-4">Carbon Footprint: What It Means</h2>

    <p>
        A <b>carbon footprint</b> measures the total greenhouse gases (GHGs), primarily CO₂, released into the atmosphere due to human activities. These emissions arise from energy consumption at home, transportation, food production, and waste management. Every action we take, from turning on lights to flying, leaves an environmental impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Energy Consumption at Home:</b> Electricity, heating, and cooking fuel contribute a significant portion of household emissions. For example, using coal-powered electricity emits around 0.9 kg CO₂ per kWh. Switching to renewable energy sources like solar or wind can drastically reduce this impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Transportation:</b> One of the largest contributors to carbon emissions. Cars, buses, trains, and airplanes burn fossil fuels, releasing CO₂. An average round-trip long-haul flight emits about 1–1.5 tons of CO₂ per passenger. To put it into perspective, if your annual footprint is around 6.5 tons, that’s equivalent to approximately four long-haul flights or twenty short domestic flights.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Food & Diet:</b> The production and transportation of food also generate emissions. Diets high in red meat and dairy have a much larger carbon footprint than plant-based diets. For instance, one kilogram of beef generates about 27 kg of CO₂ equivalent, while a kilogram of legumes produces just 2–3 kg.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Waste & Recycling:</b> Household waste generates methane in landfills if not properly managed. Recycling and composting reduce emissions. For example, recycling one ton of paper can save about 4 tons of CO₂ emissions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Fun Fact:</b> Your personal carbon footprint can be related to airplane emissions. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>6.5 tons CO₂ ≈ 4 long-haul flights per passenger</li>
        <li>6.5 tons CO₂ ≈ 20 short domestic flights per passenger</li>
        <li>Understanding this makes it easier to visualize the impact of your daily activities!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>How to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint:</b> Small changes can make a big difference:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use public transportation, carpool, walk, or cycle whenever possible.</li>
        <li>Switch to energy-efficient appliances, LED lighting, and solar energy at home.</li>
        <li>Adopt a plant-based diet or reduce high-emission foods like red meat.</li>
        <li>Reduce, reuse, and recycle to minimize waste emissions.</li>
        <li>Offset emissions by planting trees or supporting renewable energy projects.</li>
        <li>Educate others and participate in local sustainability initiatives.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Being aware of your carbon footprint and taking proactive steps can significantly contribute to mitigating climate change. Every small action counts, from turning off unused lights to choosing eco-friendly travel options.
