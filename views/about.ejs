      <h2 class="fw-bold text-success mb-3">About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        The <b>Carbon Footprint Calculator</b> is a web-based tool created to help 
        individuals measure their environmental impact. By entering everyday lifestyle data 
        (transportation, home energy use, diet, and waste habits), users can estimate 
        their yearly carbon emissions. This project was inspired by the global need for 
        climate awareness and sustainable living practices.

      <h3 class="fw-bold text-success mt-5">About Me</h3>
      <p>
        This project was developed as part of my academic and personal journey in 
        Computer Science and sustainability. The main requirements and goals were:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Raise awareness about individual carbon footprints.</li>
        <li>Implement user-friendly forms to collect lifestyle data.</li>
        <li>Apply standard emission factors for calculations.</li>
        <li>Provide clear results to raise awareness about carbon impact.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- <h3 class="fw-bold text-success mt-5">Tech Stack</h3>

      <h3 class="fw-bold text-success mt-5">Why It Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Reducing our carbon footprint is essential to slowing down climate change, 
        preserving biodiversity, and ensuring a sustainable future. 
        This calculator helps people understand their personal role in the bigger picture 
        and motivates small, meaningful changes.

      <h3 class="fw-bold text-success mt-5">Future Enhancements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Add visual reports using Chart.js for results.</li>
        <li> Provide country-specific emission factors.</li>
        <li> Allow users to track and compare past results.</li>
        <li> Give personalized recommendations to reduce footprint.</li>
        <li> User accounts for saving data securely.</li>
      </ul>
